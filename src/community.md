# Wanna ask, discuss about airsonic?

We have several places outside of github for community discussion, questions, etc:

- [#airsonic:matrix.org on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#airsonic:matrix.org)
- [#airsonic on IRC](http://webchat.freenode.net?channels=%23airsonic)
- [airsonic subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/airsonic)

*Note that the Matrix room and IRC channel are bridged together.*
