# Airsonic documentation

Welcome to the Airsonic documentation. This guide describes installation process for Airsonic, a free, web-based media streamer, providing ubiquitous access to your music.

> **Before following any docs, be sure that your system is up-to-date!**

- Follow the :rocket: for the recommended installation.
- Follow the :ship: for the docker installation.

## TL;DR

1. [Install Airsonic :rocket: :ship:](./install/)
2. [From Subsonic ? Migrate](./migrate/)
3. [Some tweaking](./configure/)
3. [Want an external database ?](./database/)
4. [Set a reverse proxy](./proxy/)
5. [Stay up to date](./update/)
5. [For developers](./developer/)

## Longer version

Start by installing Airsonic using the [install documentation](./install/). If you come from [Subsonic](http://www.subsonic.org/pages/index.jsp), you can migrate using our [migration guide](./migrate/).

Fine tune your application, like the root url, and some others configuration with the [configuration documentation](./configure/)  

Using an external database for large music collection can only be useful, just follow our [database documentation](/docs/database) to set it up.

We suggest putting Airsonic behind a reverse proxy in order to enable SSL, cache files, secure the backend, redirect traffic... This can be done with the [proxy setup documentation](./proxy).

Don't forget to keep your airsonic instance [up to date](./update)!

If you find yourself searching how to set a proper development environment for Airsonic, oh pretty please [follow this guide](./developer/).
