## Airsonic demo

Sadly, we currently don't provide any demo of airsonic, still some screenshots are available.

We are looking for an Airsonic instance with some __free__ albums on it ! A link to it could be added on this page.

Please contact us using a [github issue](https://github.com/airsonic/airsonic/issues) or on the [community channels](/contribute/#wanna-ask-discuss-about-airsonic-).


## Airsonic new UI

Some contributors are currently working on a brand new UI.

Based on Angular 4, we aims to provide a modern and fast new UI. This work also leads use to a proper frontend-backend separation.

A demo is available here, you just need to enter you server address and your creditials to log in !

If you want to contribute please come to our [github repository](https://github.com/airsonic/airsonic-ui).
